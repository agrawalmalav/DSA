Given the head of a singly linked list of integers, find and return its length.


Example:

Sample Linked List
The length of the list is 4. Hence we return 4.


Note:

Exercise caution when dealing with edge cases, such as when the head is NULL. Failing to handle these edge cases appropriately may result in a runtime error in your code.

Input format :

The first and only line contains elements of the singly linked list separated by a single space. 

 Remember/Consider :

While specifying the list elements for input, -1 indicates the end of the singly linked list and hence, would never be a list element.

Output format :

The output contains a single integer denoting the length of the linked list.

Sample Input 1 :

3 4 5 2 6 1 9 -1

Sample Output 1 :

7


Explanation of sample input 1 :

The number of nodes in the given linked list is 7.
Hence we return 7.


Sample Input 2 :

10 76 39 -3 2 9 -23 9 -1

Sample Output 2 :

8

 Constraints :

0 <= N <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
