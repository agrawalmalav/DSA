Send Feedback
You are given an integer array 'arr' of size 'N'.


You must sort this array using 'Insertion Sort' recursively.


 Note:

Change in the input array itself. You don't need to return or print the elements.

Example:

Input: ‘N’ = 7
'arr' = [2, 13, 4, 1, 3, 6, 28]

Output: [1 2 3 4 6 13 28]

Explanation: After applying insertion sort on the input array, the output is [1 2 3 4 6 13 28].

 Input format :

The first line contains an integer 'N' representing the size of the array.

The second line contains 'N' single space-separated integers representing the elements of the array.

Output Format :

Print the array elements in sorted order, separated by a single space.

Sample Input 1:

5
9 3 6 2 0

Sample Output 1:

0 2 3 6 9

Sample Input 2:

4
4 3 2 1

Sample Output 2:

1 2 3 4 

Constraints :

0 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= arr[i] <= 10^5
Time Limit: 1 sec
