 Merge Sort Code
Send Feedback
You are given the starting 'l' and the ending 'r' positions of the array 'ARR'.


You must sort the elements between 'l' and 'r'.


Note:

Change in the input array itself. So no need to return or print anything.

Example:

Input: ‘N’ = 7,
'ARR' = [2, 13, 4, 1, 3, 6, 28]

Output: [1 2 3 4 6 13 28]

Explanation: After applying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is [1 2 3 4 6 13 28].

Input format :

The first line contains an integer <em>**'N'**</em> representing the size of the array/list.

The second line contains 'N' single space-separated integers representing the elements in the array/list.

Output format :

You don't need to return anything. In the output, you will see the array after you do the modification.

Sample Input 1:

7
2 13 4 1 3 6 28

Sample Output 1:

1 2 3 4 6 13 28

Explanation of Sample Output 1:

After applying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is [1 2 3 4 6 13 28].

Sample Input 2:

5
9 3 6 2 0

Sample Output 2:

0 2 3 6 9

Explanation of Sample Output 2:

After applying 'merge sort' on the input array, the output is [0 2 3 6 9].

Constraints :

1 <= N <= 10^3
0 <= ARR[i] <= 10^9
